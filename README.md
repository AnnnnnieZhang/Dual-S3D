M3D is a high-fidelity framework for reconstructing 3D scenes and objects from a single RGB image. This framework combines state-of-the-art dual-stream feature extraction and depth-driven methodologies to deliver superior performance in challenging scenarios, such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics.
